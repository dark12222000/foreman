Foreman is a process control wrapper for minecraft. It exposes a REST api with JSON (using CORS). Foreman will launch and monitor Minecraft, and allow you to remotely start/stop/restart as well as issue commands.  Foreman is independent of Minecraft versions, and thus will work fine with Bukkit or other modded versions.
